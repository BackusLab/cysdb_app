The Cysteineome Database was created by Lisa Boatner (Backus Lab) & Dr. Devin Schweppe (Schweppe Lab).

Cysteine chemoproteomics studies provide proteome-wide portraits of the ligandability or potential ‘druggability’ of thousands of cysteine residues. Consequently, these studies are enabling resources for closing the druggability gap, namely achieving pharmacological manipulation of ~99% of the human proteome that remains untargeted by FDA approved small molecules. CysDB is a SQL relational database that is publicly available at https://backuslab.shinyapps.io/cysdb/ and features chemoproteomic measures of identification, hyperreactivity, and ligandability for 62,888 cysteines (24% of all cysteines the human proteome). The CysDB web application also includes annotations of functionality (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, Pfam, Panther), known druggability (FDA approved targets, DrugBank, ChEMBL), disease-relevance and genetic variation (ClinVar, Cancer Gene Census, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), and structural features (Protein Data Bank). Showcasing the utility of CysDB, here we report the discovery and enrichment of ligandable cysteines in undruggable classes of proteins, the observation that a subset of cysteines showed marked preference for specific classes of electrophiles (chloroacetamide vs acrylamide), and that ligandable cysteines are present in numerous undrugged disease-relevant proteins. Most importantly, we have designed CysDB for the incorporation of new datasets and features to support the continued growth of the druggable cysteineome.
